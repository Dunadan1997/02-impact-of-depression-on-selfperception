# New Wine for New Wineskins?

Suffering is transformative, so we are told. The goal of my analysis is to empirically test this claim. Taking my cue from Timothy Keller, I broke down the transformative impact of suffering into four categories and identified a number of dependent variables to assess the impact of suffering on each claim as holistically as possible:

1. Suffering transforms our sense of self-control, making us more aware of our own vulnerability.
   a. 

3. Suffering transforms our relationship with the good things in life, like our family and job, showing us that we cannot rely on them for our ultimate source of meaning and satisfaction.
    a.

5. Suffering transforms our relationship with God, drawing us closer to Him.
   a.

7. Suffering transforms our relationship with others, urging us to be more compasionnate and empathic.
   a.

The average score... 

I am using data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) to test each of these separate claims. The SHP is a longitudinal survey that follows individuals and households over time to record and analyse social changes in the Swiss population. The SHP collects data since 1999 and continues to do so every year. It is a robust data set from which to draw statistical inferences.

# How Depression Shapes Our Sense of Control

Is suffering transformative? 

Many traditions consider it a necessary and constructive guide, when it is not fatal. Suffering, they say, forces us to change the way we perceive ourself and the world, bringing us closer to the meaning of life. 

In my recent exploration into the data, I delved into the nuances of depression - a poignant form of suffering - and its influence on our sense of control. The results, depicted in the accompanying graphs, offer intriguing insights.

The left graph gauges our agreement with feeling powerless over life events. The impact of our first encounter with depression lingers, portraying a sense of powerlessness that surpasses both pre- and post-depression periods. Similarly, the right graph, measuring our belief in our control on life events, shows a marked dip during the initial bout of depression, with a lasting effect.

Notably, the data hints at a sustained transformation post-depression. Although this enduring impact could be attributed to recurring depressive episodes, hindering a complete restoration to pre-depression levels, it may also be due to the transformative impact of suffering.

These graphs, depicting opposite sides of the same coin, suggest that suffering, in the form of depression, wields a lasting influence on how we perceive and exert control over our lives.

This observation will resonate with many. A lot of us have stood atop the pedestal of invincibility, only to be brought back to reality by life's challenges. One way suffering hurts is by making us realize how little control we actually have. However, given we have the social support necessary to help us process this experience, suffering can be beneficial, leading to a more realistic sense of control, to an existence that is more attuned with the independent ways of the world (and our body), that is more modest and humble about the capacities of the self (and the mind), and more aware of its limitations and vulnerabilities. 

What do you think? Has suffering played some purposeful role in your life? Feel free to share your point of view in the comments. 

p.s. I was inspired to do the analysis upon reading Timothy Keller's book...
