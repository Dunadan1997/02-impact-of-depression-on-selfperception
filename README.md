# New Wine for New Wineskins?

Suffering is transformative, so we are told. The goal of my analysis is to empirically test this claim. Taking my cue from Timothy Keller, I broke down the transformative impact of suffering into four categories and identified a number of dependent variables to assess the impact of suffering on each claim as holistically as possible:

1. Suffering transforms our sense of self-control, making us more aware of our own vulnerability.
   a. 

3. Suffering transforms our relationship with the good things in life, like our family and job, showing us that we cannot rely on them for our ultimate source of meaning and satisfaction.
    a.

5. Suffering transforms our relationship with God, drawing us closer to Him.
   a.

7. Suffering transforms our relationship with others, urging us to be more compasionnate and empathic.
   a.

The average score... 

I am using data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) to test each of these separate claims. The SHP is a longitudinal survey that follows individuals and households over time to record and analyse social changes in the Swiss population. The SHP collects data since 1999 and continues to do so every year. It is a robust data set from which to draw statistical inferences.

# How Depression Shapes Our Sense of Control

Suffering is transformative. Many religions and practical philosophies consider it as a necessary part of life. Suffering, they say, serves as a learning tool, when it is not fatal. It forces us to change the way we perceive ourself and the world. Hoefully, bringing us closer to the meaning of it all. 

To infuse some data driven insights into this tradition, I examined some different ways in which depression - a form of suffering - shapes our sense of control. 

Looking at the graph on the left that when depression first hits, we feel on average the most powerless we will ever feel 10 years before and after this depression. The same is true for the graph on the right, where we feel on average the most helpful during our first depression we will ever feel 10 years before and after this depression. In both graphs, we see there does not seem to be a return to normal, even many years after our first depression. On average, we tend to feel we have less infulence on life events and feel that what happens depends less on us. This effect remains long after the first depression, suggesting suffering has a transformative effect. This may also be due to the fact that people may also experience more than one depression, which may hinder a return back to normal. 

The two graphs represent two sides of the same coin. The data suggests suffering has a lasting impact on our sense of control, both in the way in which we perceive our influence on the world and in the way we perceive our control over the world. 

As almost every youngster, I thought myself invicible, capable of all deeds, shying away from no challenge. That is, until one day I was brought back to reality from the high tower of my self-estime. This is one way in which suffering can be painful, by making us realize how little in control we are - a devastating realization. In the long run, however, I believe this epiphany can be beneficial, leading to a more realistic sense of control, to an existence that is more attuned with the independent ways of the world (and our boday), that is more modest and humble about the capacities of the self (and the mind), and more aware of its limitations and vulnerabilities. 

What do you think? Has suffering played some purposeful role in your life? Feel free to share your point of view in the comments. 

p.s. I was inspired to do the analysis upon reading Timothy Keller's book...
