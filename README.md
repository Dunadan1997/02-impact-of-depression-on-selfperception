# New Wine fro New Wineskins?

Suffering is transformative, so we are told. The goal of my analysis is to empirically test this claim. Taking my cue from Timothy Keller, I broke down the transformative impact of suffering into four categories:

1. Suffering transforms our sense of self-control, making us more aware of our own vulnerability.

2. Suffering transforms our relationship with the good things in life, like our family and job, showing us that we cannot rely on them for our ultimate source of meaning and satisfaction.

3. Suffering transforms our relationship with God, drawing us closer to Him.

4. Suffering transforms our relationship with others, urging us to be more compasionnate and empathic.

I am using data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) to test each of these separate claims. The SHP is a longitudinal survey that follows individuals and households over time to record and analyse social changes in the Swiss population. The SHP collects data since 1999 and continues to do so every year. It is a robust data set from which to draw statistical inferences.
